# GPIO 19 is prox ranging start pin
#     (Mini breakout: GP19, J18 #6, Default: I2C1_SCL)
#
# Most obvious place to manipulate is here, mode0 is hopefully
#     "don't mess with this pin":
#     $ echo mode0 > /sys/kernel/debug/gpio_debug/gpio19/current_pinmux
#
# HOWEVER, exporting the pin and controlling it directly appears to work as
#     well (throws an error if already mapped)
#
echo 19 > /sys/class/gpio/export 2>/dev/null
#
# Make it an output
#     $ echo out > /sys/kernel/debug/gpio_debug/gpio19/current_direction
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio19/direction
#
# Set it to low
#     $ echo low > /sys/kernel/debug/gpio_debug/gpio19/current_value
#
echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio19/value
#
# The above was enough to make it start ranging (using the /debug subsystem)
#     after it had stopped. The rest may be stupid.
#     Especially because cat'ing the value still indicates low.
